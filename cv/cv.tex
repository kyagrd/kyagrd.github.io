\begin{comment}
\section{Summary of \\my Research Contributions}
%% \hspace*{2ex} My main line of research in recent years has been around
%% my PhD thesis:
%% \begin{quote}
%% We can design a functional language that can be used as a logically consistent
%% theorem prover exploiting Curry--Howard correspondence, while maintaining most
%% of the features familiar to functional programmers who are not necessarily
%% highly exposed to dependently-typed proof assistants.
%% \end{quote}
%% There are two advantages of developing such a language. First is
%% the accessibility from a broader user base because of the little learning curve,
%% compared to being exposed to fully dependent type systems in proof assistants.
%% %% Although dependently typed proof assistants based on the Curry--Howard
%% %% correspondence have have many similarities to functional languages,
%% %% there exists some noticeable differences in their type system when compared to
%% %% the typical type systems of functional languages
%% %% (e.g., predicative stratified universe,
%% %% lack of Hindley--Milner-style type inference,
%% %% strict-positivity restriction on datatype declarations,
%% %% and difficulties in type erasure at compile time).
%% Second is the possibility of collecting low-hanging fruit from
%% the existing theories and tools developed around functional languages.

%% \hspace*{2ex}
The contributions of my reseach can be categorized into three areas:
\begin{description}
\item[~~Executable relational specifications of polymorhpic type systems.]~

\hspace*{1ex}
I (in collaboration with Vezzosi) provided an executable specification
\cite{AhnVez16} of an advanced type system that supports
parametric polymorphism in several dimensions including type polymorphism,
type constructor polymorphism, and kind polymorphism (all in rank-1, for type
inference). The specification is succinct, declarative, and it also servers
as a reference implementation for type inference --- key features of Nax
including pattern matching and Mendler-style iteration could be specified
in less than 100 lines of Prolog. The specification is not only short
but also highly readable because of its structural resemblance to
the typing rules typically used for describing type systems on paper.
In addition, this specification can execute queries of type inference
by exploiting backward-chaining of Prolog as well as checking types.
Recently, I was able to identify key ingredients to specify
extensible records  $[\text{\hyperref[u2]{u2}}]$.
% Supporting other features such as first-class polymorphism, modules, and
% GADTs with term indices are left for future work.

\hspace*{1ex}
I have initiated \href{http://kyagrd.github.com/tiper/}{a project called TIPER}
in order to realize the idea from this line of research (i.e., logic programming
for executable specification of type systems) into a practical tool
that automates type system implementation in compiler construction and
plug-ins for development tools. We already have tools  (e.g. Yacc) for
automatically generating parsers from declarative grammar rule specifications
but in lack of tools for automatically generating type system implementations
supporting polymorphic type inference from typing rule specifications.


\item[~~Mendler-style recursion schemes for mixed-variant datatypes.]~

\hspace*{1ex}
My contribution in Mendler-style recursion schemes for mixed-variant datatypes
provides the basis for safely supporting mixed-variant datatype declarations
in the Nax language and future language designs to be inspired by Nax.
Mainstream dependently typed proof assistants disallow
mixed-variant datatype declarations.

\hspace*{1ex}
I (in collaboration with Sheard) discovered a Mendler-style version
\cite{Ahn11} of the cata-morphism over datatypes
with contravariant recursive occurrences\footnote{ Datatypes with both
	covariant and contravariant recursive occurrences are also known as
	\emph{mixed-variant datatypes}. } (Fegaras and Sheard 2009).
% We named our recursion scheme as the Mendler-style Shared--Fegaras iteration
% (in abbr., \textbf{msfit}). 
Discovering Mendler-style counterparts is more than
mere reformulation of already known recursion schemes.
Unlike conventional recursion schemes, Mendler-style recursion schemes
naturally generalize non-regular datatypes including nested datatypes and
GADTs. In addition, previous studies on Mendler-style recursion schemes
were mostly focused on datatypes with covariant recursive occurrences.

\hspace*{1ex}
Recently, I (in collaboration with Fiore and Sheard)
formulated a Mendler-style version $[\text{\hyperref[u1]{u1}}]$ of
the parametric\footnote{
	As in \emph{parametric} higher-order absract syntax (PHOAS).}
variant of the (non-Mendler-style) Sheard--Fegaras catamorphsim
(Bahr and Hvitved 2012).
However, investigations on the termination properties of
this new recursion scheme are still left for future work.

\item[~~Typed lambda calculi with erasable term indices.]~

\hspace*{1ex}
I (in collaboration with Sheard, Pitts, and Fiore) provided
a baseline understanding of generalized algebraic datatypes (GADTs) with
real term indices and their associated Mendler-style recursion schemes,
by formulating System~$\mathrm{F}_i$ \cite{AhnSheFioPit13}, which extends
System~$\textrm{F}_\omega$ with erasable term indices. System~$\mathrm{F}_i$
is carefully designed to inherit the desirable properties of
System $\mathrm{F}_\omega$ including type preservation and logical consistency.
In my dissertation \cite{AhnPhdThesis14}, I also show that the same extension
can be applied to System~$\mathrm{Fix}_\omega$ (Abel and Matthes 2004)
designed for embedding the Mendler-style primitive recursion.

\hspace*{1ex}
Polymorphic lambda calculi provide us a baseline understanding of
the type systems of functional languages. For example, we know that
extensions to HM such as higher-rank types will not break properties
proven to hold in System~F because higher-rank polymorphism is already
part of System~F. Datatypes and pattern matching can also be understood
within a pure polymorphic lambda calculus via the B\"ohm-Berarducci encoding.
Functional languages with more advanced type systems that support
type constructor polymorphism (a.k.a., higher-kinded polymorphism) could
be understood in terms of System~$\textrm{F}_\omega$.
Due to my contribution of formulating System~$\mathrm{F}_i$,
our baseline understanding now extends over GADTs with real term indicies.
% Further possible extensions to System~$\mathrm{F}_i$ are left for future work.

\vspace*{1.5ex}
In addition to my contributions in the three major areas mentioned
above, I have several other research interests and experiences including
the following items: 
\begin{itemize}
\item During my research internship at NASA Ames, I used QuickCheck
	to generate test cases for the first-order axioms for proving
	automatically generated verification conditions \cite{Ahn10,Ahn13}.
	The main challenge was to cut down the vacuously satisfiable
	tests caused by the variables inside the premise (i.e., left-hand side
	of the implication).
\item I participated in the Trellys research group \cite{Kimmell12,Vilhelm12},
	which was an inter-institutional project funded by the NSF
	in the USA. The goal of the project was to develop
	a dependently typed language that can be used for both
	logical reasoning and programming.
% The Trellys group designed a language
% \cite{Kimmell:2012:ERP:2103776.2103780,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1202-2923}
% that has two modes of type checking, one for paradox-free proofs
% (as in proof assistants) and the other for programming
% (as in Turing-complete general purpose programing languages),
% and these two modes of typing judgements can carefully refer to each other.

\end{itemize}
